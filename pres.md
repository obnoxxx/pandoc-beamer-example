# What is \LaTeX\ ?

\LaTeX\ is a document typesetting system for creating professional (often scientifcic) documents.

It is rendered (e. g. to PDF) from a plain-text markup input file.

Even easier with markdown source via wiki2beamer and pandoc


Writing \LaTeX\  documents is a bit like programming.


The plain text nature of the input allows to add it to version control (like `git`).
